### Project Overview:
This project is part of Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Program and is one of the most popular Udacity projects across machine learning and artificial intellegence nanodegree programs. The goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed. Here we are preparing a model to identify dog faces, human faces and their breeds also. 

### Project Motivation
Face Recognition or Image processing is a significant skill needed in today's industry. Here Udacity honoured us by giving a chance to implement such a practical project for our final project. Moreover besides recognition of picture as dog or human, classifying them into breeds is definately also a source of sure Motivation

### Problem Statement :
Here we are focussing to use CNN to detect dog images.
	1) In this, the model should detect that the input image is of a dog or human or none of them. 
	2) If it is detected as dog, than detect the breed of dog.
	3) If it is detected as human, then detect the breed of dog which closely resemble to that image.
	
### Solution Strategies:
We are following the following steps to solve the problem statement.
	1) We are using OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect that the image is of human face or not.
	2) We are using RestNet50 to detect the image of Dog face or not.
	3) Lastly if it is human or dog detected face, then we are using CNN along with VGG19 BottleNeck features to detect the dog breed or the breed that closely resemble to that human face respectively.
	
### Project Challenges and Solving Strategy:
As a beginner to CNN, I felt breed classification is the most challenging part. But the  guidance on that have truely helped. Plus experimentation on number of filters also saw increase in accuracy. As the dataset was small, overfitting was a issue in that case. Using a Dropout layer with droping rate of 30% was added to prevent overfitting.

### Libraries:
The libraries used in this project are:

	Keras: RestNet50 and Image function is ued from Keras.
	OpenCV: OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is used for human face detection.
	Matplotlib: It is using for visualization of the dog dataset w.r.t Dog Breeds.
	Numpy: This is used to make arrays of the dog and human datasets.

### Data Description:
There are following datasets available for this Model:
	Dog Images :- There is dataset of dog images where there 8351 images with 133 breeds.
			8351 dog images are divided into 3 datasets:
			Train Dataset with 6680 images.
			Validation Dataset with 835 images.
			Test Dataset with 836 images.
	Human Images :- There is a dataset with 13233 images in it.

### Data Preprocessing
Not much Preprocessing is done in this dataset. We have only loaded the data from Udacity Workspace. Dog Data was already divided into train, Validation and Test Data. Only we performed little normalization on the image data and "to_categorical" function on the targets. 

### File Description:
Below are main foleders/files for this project:

haarcascades
haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml: a pre-trained face detector provided by OpenCV
bottleneck_features
DogVGG19Data.npz: pre-computed the bottleneck features for VGG-19 using dog image data including training, validation, and test
saved_models
VGG19_model.json: model architecture saved in a json file
weights.best.VGG19.hdf5: saved model weights with best validation loss
dog_app.ipynb: a notebook used to build and train the dog breeds classification model
extract_bottleneck_features.py: functions to compute bottleneck features given a tensor converted from an image
images: a few images to test the model manually
	
### Algorithm and Implementation
dog_breed_algorithm function contains the final algorithm which execute the whole functionality. 
	Step 1: Firstly we are using "dog_detector" model to detect is it a dog face or not. In this RestNet50 is used to do the detection.
		If it comes dog, then it will detect its breed.
	Step 2: If it is not detected as a dog face, then "face_detector" is detecting it as a human face or not.Here we have used CV2 implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect the human faces
		If it is detected as human, then detect the dog breed that closely resemble to it.
	Step 3: If it neither detected as human or dog, then show that message. 

As a beginner to CNN, I felt breed classification is the most challenging part. But the  guidance on that have truely helped. Plus experimentation on number of filters also saw increase in accuracy. As the dataset was small, overfitting was a issue in that case. Using a Dropout layer with droping rate of 30% was added to prevent overfitting. Moreover changing the activation method of last layer to softmax  helped in reaching the goal accuracy.

### Model Evaluation
Here we have used CNN with VGG19 BottleNeck Feature to identify the the 133 dog breeds. 
	1) One GlobalAveragePooling2D layer is used to get the VGG output.
	2) One dense layer is used using relu activation and 200 nodes.
	3) As the size of dataset is small, we have used a Dropout Layer.
	4) Lastly one more Dense Layer with Softmax 
The aim was to attain atleast 66% acurracy. This model gave a 70.2% of accuracy on test data.

### Justifiaction
	Adding a layer of Relu Activation has substantially increased the metric(Accuracy) of the model. Since, the dataset is small, there was a chance 
	of overfitting which can decrease the performance for unknown data. Thus we have used a dropout rate of 30%. Lastly we preferred 20 epochs for training.

### Results
	The algo is detecting dog image correctly.
	The algo is detecting human image correctly.
	The algo gave a 70.2153% test accuracy.
	Thus the total algorithm is solving the three statements of the problem statement nicely. It is taking an image as input, doing classification as dog or human or neither 	  of two and then the breed.

### Discussion
	When we used VGG16 with two layers and softmax activation we got near about 44.6% accuracy.
	In the VGG19 Model, firstly only Relu Activation was used, but suprisingly after 20 epoch training it did not reached the 66% Accuracy level. Changing number of nodes 		and changing activation of one layer to softmax increased the accuracy to 70%.

### Improvements and Refinements
	Here we have used only 133 dog breeds to classify. Many dog breed are their whose facial features resemble each other closely. So more classification among 
	dog breed will be nice which analyzez unique features in each breed. This can be done by feeding it with more variation in train dataset. Particularly 
	classification of special and minute features as tere are breeds with almost 805 simmilarity in apearance.
	1) Increasing the dataset will improve performance and accuracy. 2) Increasing number of epochs in training will improve performance and accuracy. 3) Adding more layers 	in the CNN will improve performance and accuracy.
